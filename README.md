# GitcoinDAO-Themed-POAP-Templates
My submission for GitcoinDAO-Themed POAP Templates

The POAP templates are designed in the spirit of the GitcoinDAO with space, shapes and web3 in mind. The entire template is modular with 4 core color blends and 4 shapes. Text position is static with logo in the middle (can be changed to something different if necessary). I've included an example for the monthly steward sync just to show how easy its to integrate any picture or illustration in the template.
